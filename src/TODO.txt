FindDeathAlchemyItems : Take count into account when traversing leveled lists, so as not to select too many items
			alternatively remove chances completely, to get the item that could drop.
	work out guidelines when to give which npc which item.


TODO for all kinds of features

Read SPID config files, to extract alchemyitems from
make own config file format, for declaration of items
make function that automaticall extracts all alchemyitems from the game to a config file

make NPCs use Potions of Cure Disease if they have some (would need be tracking outside of combat

followers use poisons from their inventory on worthy enemies. Like magicka poisons on enemies with high magicka and high
	level.
followers use scrolls? maybe we need to see about that, since it may not be doable behind the scenes (and doesn't
	fit the mod theme)

use fortify potions
	when wearing an appropiate weapon, spell, with a customisable chance
	chance increasing with enemy level

intern cooldown for potions based on current running duration (maybe compute expected actor value if potion completes)

distribute potions and poisons to npcs that enter combat exept followers (CurrentFollowerFaction)
